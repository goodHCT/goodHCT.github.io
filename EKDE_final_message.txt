Thank you for taking the time to read my article. I'm ice-v5, the author of the Chinese localization Ice modded version of Rusted Warfare. The players with IDs like ice-v123 that you see on the official server are all users of my localized mod. Since childhood, I've been fascinated by video games. Being able to create mods for games and let others experience interesting content brings me great joy.

One day, I left the original mod development team(called CW) and decided to work on an old mod called EK. At that time, I thought although this mod looked quite poor (with broken balance, numerous bugs, even misplaced textures, and at that time the existing Chinese localization was of very low quality)(I later found out that version it was not made by videogames, it is a CN community version, my EKDE was based on videogames one, the EK1.1.1, EK1.1.1 is actually not bad.), maybe a complete reconstruction could give it new life. However, who could have predicted that this decision would bring me a series of troubles.

For more than two years, I almost devoted all my energy to creating this mod. Every day, I sat in front of my computer, carefully reviewing lines of code and fixing bugs one by one. Units were added in batches. Sometimes, to implement new features, I stayed up all night - these efforts have been witnessed by many old friends in the community. After a lot of hard work, the mod finally started to take shape and gradually gained recognition within the community (I even optimized the English descriptions for units, adding English text to all my newly added units. To this day, it remains one of the top ten most popular mods on Steam Workshop, with subscription rates exceeding 50% of click-through rates, achieving international acclaim).

However, as the saying goes, "a tree that grows too tall will be struck by lightning." Unknown groups of people began to target my mod. They spread rumors online using extremely malicious methods. Sometimes they posted videos on Bilibili claiming my mod lacked official authorization and was a false version; at other times they spread false information in game communities, accusing my mod of being pirated. Most disturbingly, they even modified my version, adding deliberate bugs, mismatched textures, and unbalanced units to damage the reputation of the mod itself. I just couldn't understand - I've never stolen anything or committed any wrongdoing, yet here I was facing these unfair accusations.

Many people don't know that I have always protected the peace within our RW community. Previously in the list server, I found someone selling explicit content in the user list. This kind of player-harming behavior was unacceptable to me, so using my technical knowledge, I directly took down their servers. There was another time when a group of online bullies tried to forcefully infiltrate our game community with improper means to seize control. With the help of several brave friends, we worked hard to drive them out. On a daily basis, whenever new players asked me about mod development, I would always share my knowledge willingly - teaching them coding and explaining logical principles. In the past, I was widely regarded as a generous person within the community. I believe I've never done anything wrong, yet these villains still wouldn't leave me alone.

These villains colluded with each other, spreading false information on social media platforms to defame me. Some even used my avatar and nickname to provoke conflicts online. Since then, there have been many negative messages about me online, with many players believing them and turning against me (some people even blamed my version for balance issues caused by pirated content THAT THEY MADE). During this period, I felt deeply wronged every day while reading these comments - it was like seeing humanity's moral standards being repeatedly broken. They constantly spread rumors that I wanted to destroy the Iron Circle community, although this has never happened.

Later on, with no other choice and facing the pressure of preparing for my university entrance exams, I had to leave the EK mod I loved so much. The worst and most devastating event then occurred: a villain called "Kitasan Black" took over my groups and mod, even deceiving the foreign community managers(Stroheim). They claimed that Stroheim was actually the author (who was merely a community manager, not the mod developer) and accused me of making an unauthorized pirated version. In reality, "lack of original authorization" is one of the most common tactics used to deprive developers of their hard work. As long as social media platforms can spread rumors, they can achieve their goals, WHILE MOST DEVELOPERS ARE NOT GOOD AT COMMUNICATION.

Now, I can only use my final means to defend my dignity, although these methods are not kind. I deeply apologize to any players disturbed by this situation.
